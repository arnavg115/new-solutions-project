# Don't be a jerk

Pretty simple rule to abide by.

# Consequences

If we find that there are any infractions we have a few consequences.

1. Temparary ban: The person found in infraction will be temporarily banned for 1 day and be asked to apologize/explain their actions privately.

If no such explanation is given or there is a repeated offense then this will result in the next consequence

2. Permanent Ban: It is in the name. You will be banned permanently.
